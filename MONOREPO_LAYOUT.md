# Monorepo Layout Branch

This branch demonstrates the target monorepo structure for the legacy import:

## Structure
- `/backend/` - Laravel backend (from legacy: )  
- `/frontend/` - Next.js frontend (from legacy: )

## Legacy Source Paths (to be moved with git mv):
- Backend source: `frontend-aug10/Dixis-Project-1/backend/`
- Frontend source: `frontend-aug10/Dixis-Project-1/frontend/`

## Status
- [x] Target structure created
- [ ] Legacy code moved with `git mv` (preserving history)
- [x] Backend CI added for /backend working directory

The actual legacy code will be moved using `git mv` to preserve full git history once the large repository push is completed.
