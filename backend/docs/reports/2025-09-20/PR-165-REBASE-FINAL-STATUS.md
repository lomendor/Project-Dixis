# PR #165 - Rebase & CI Status Report (2025-09-20)

## PR: feat(producer): onboarding + admin moderation

### ✅ Rebase & Conflict Resolution Complete

**Conflicts Resolved:**
- **TestCase.php**: Merged RefreshDatabase + Http::preventStrayRequests
- **ProductFactory.php**: Kept title field fix + main formatting  
- **User.php**: Kept both addresses() and notifications() methods
- **producer/products/page.tsx**: Kept full producer onboarding implementation
- **Migration Duplicate**: Removed older shipments migration, kept comprehensive one from main

### 🔧 CI Status: MIXED

**✅ PASSING (Core Backend):**
- php-tests ✅
- backend ✅  
- e2e-tests ✅
- integration ✅
- danger ✅

**❌ FAILING (Frontend TypeScript):**
- type-check ❌ - User type mismatch (missing updated_at field)
- frontend ❌ - Build failure due to TS errors
- lighthouse ❌ - Depends on frontend build
- PR Hygiene Check ❌
- Quality Assurance ❌

### 📋 Remaining TypeScript Issues
```
useProducerAuth.ts:
- User type mismatch between api.ts and models.ts (missing updated_at)
- Role comparison issue ("admin" not in "consumer" | "producer" type)
```

### 🚀 Next Steps Required
1. Fix TypeScript type definitions in useProducerAuth.ts
2. Align User interface between api.ts and models.ts
3. Update role type to include "admin" if needed

**Status**: Backend CI FIXED ✅ | Frontend needs TypeScript fixes ⚠️  
**Auto-merge**: Enabled, waiting for all checks to pass
