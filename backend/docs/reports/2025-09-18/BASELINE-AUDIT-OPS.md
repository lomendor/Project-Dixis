TL;DR
- Danger quality gates are active on main with null‑safety guards and correct rule set (LOC, docs link, controller tests, config risk, workflow/config warnings).
- PR and Issue templates exist and align with the quality gates (risk level, dated report links, acceptance criteria).
- Subagents script writes dated reports to `backend/docs/reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>/`.
- Makefile defines and wires the requested targets: `qa`, `ci-local`, `report`, `fix`.

Dangerfile (dangerfile.js)
- Null‑safety: Guards for missing `pr`/`git` contexts to avoid runtime failures in CI.
- LOC gates: fail >600 LOC if `large-diff` label missing; warn >300 LOC.
- Docs gate: requires today’s reports path in PR body when significant changes are detected.
- Controller gate: fails if backend controllers modified without test updates.
- Config risk gate: fails for backend/config or top-level config changes without a risk level in PR description.
- Workflow/config watchers: warns on workflow/action changes and on critical package/config modifications.
- Summary markdown: posts a concise Quality Gate++ summary.

PR/Issue Templates
- PR template `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` present with:
  - Scope, Acceptance Criteria, Risks/Rollback (Risk Level), CI Summary checkboxes, Documentation Links (dated reports), Type of Change, Related Issues.
- Issue templates `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` and `feature_request.md` present.

Subagents (scripts/subagents.sh)
- Writes reports under `backend/docs/reports/$DATE` with `$DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)`.
- Commands:
  - `audit` → AUDIT.md
  - `tests` → TEST-DELTA.md
  - `docs` → PR-SUMMARY.md
  - `release` → RELEASE-NOTES-DRAFT.md
  - `all` runs all. Creates headers with timestamp.

Makefile Targets
- `qa`: PHPUnit + frontend `npm run qa:all` (backend and frontend checks).
- `ci-local`: Backend tests and pint, frontend QA/build, E2E smoke run (mirrors CI workflow).
- `report`: Runs subagents `audit` and `docs`, reporting to `backend/docs/reports/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/`.
- `fix`: Backend Pint, frontend ESLint --fix, Prettier format.

Notes
- All checks were read‑only; commands not executed. File presence and wiring are correct and match the ops upgrade goals.
- Optional enhancements: add a CI job that runs `make report` and uploads artifacts; ensure CI timezone consistency for “today” in Danger checks.
