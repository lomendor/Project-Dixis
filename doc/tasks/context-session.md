- [x] Release v0.3.0-qa polishing with comprehensive changelog
- [x] Final status tables (PR, CI, branch hygiene)

## 📊 Research Findings Summary

### 1. UI Implementation Plan (32 components, 1,200-1,580 LOC)
**Status**: Foundation excellent, needs UI polish  
**File**: `doc/research/ui-plan.md`
- Cart system fully functional with Greek localization
- Producer dashboard basic implementation complete
- Focus needed: UI enhancement vs rebuild
- Timeline: 6 weeks incremental enhancement

### 2. API Implementation Plan (60+ endpoints, ~1,200 LOC)
**Status**: 80% complete, critical gaps identified  
**File**: `doc/research/api-plan.md`
- Strong foundation: auth, cart, checkout, basic producer features
- Missing: user management, reviews, payments, admin tools
- Implementation: 3-phase priority (MVP → UX → Admin)
- Timeline: 4-6 weeks implementation + 2-3 weeks testing

### 3. QA & Test Stabilization (Multiple micro-fixes, ≤30 LOC each)
**Status**: Flaky test root causes identified  
**File**: `doc/research/qa-plan.md`
- Primary issues: Promise.race() patterns, excessive timeouts
- Immediate fixes: 4 critical items (≤15-25 LOC each)
- Success target: 95% pass rate, <3min smoke tests
- PR cleanup needed: #125 superseded, branch hygiene

## 🚀 Next Phase Priorities

### Week 1-2: QA Stabilization (High Priority)
- [ ] Fix Promise.race() patterns in smoke tests
- [ ] Enhance MSW stub coverage for authenticated flows
- [ ] Standardize timeout values across test suite
- [ ] Close superseded PR #125 and cleanup branches
- **LOC Estimate**: 70-100 LOC total

### Week 3-4: API Critical Gaps (Medium Priority)
- [ ] User profile management endpoints
- [ ] Enhanced order management API
- [ ] Producer verification system
- [ ] Basic payment webhook foundation
- **LOC Estimate**: 300-400 LOC

### Week 5-6: UI Polish Phase (Medium Priority) 
- [ ] shadcn/ui component integration
- [ ] Mobile-first responsive refinements
- [ ] Micro-interactions and loading states
- [ ] Social media sharing optimization
- **LOC Estimate**: 400-600 LOC

## 📈 Success Metrics & KPIs

### Technical Health
- **Build Time**: <1.5s (current: 1136ms ✅)
- **Test Stability**: 95%+ pass rate (current: ~70%)
- **CI Pipeline**: <5min total execution
- **Code Coverage**: Backend 85%+, Frontend 70%+

### Feature Completeness
- **Marketplace MVP**: 90% complete ✅
- **Producer Tools**: 75% complete
- **User Experience**: 60% complete
- **Admin Interface**: 30% complete

## 🛡️ Constraints & Guardrails

### Technical Constraints (LOCKED)
- Next.js 15.5.0 version maintained
- Ports 8001 (backend) / 3001 (frontend) 
- No changes to .github/workflows/**
- PR size limit: ≤300 LOC per PR

### Development Principles
- Greek-first localization approach
- Mobile-first responsive design
- API-first architecture patterns
- E2E test compatibility required
- Preserve existing business logic

## 📝 Session Notes

### Key Decisions Made
1. **PR #125**: Deferred due to extensive conflicts (superseded by #136)
2. **PR #142**: Closed as superseded (conflicts vs minimal benefit)
3. **Research Approach**: Subagent specialization successful for complex planning
4. **Implementation Strategy**: Incremental enhancement vs full rebuild

### Architecture Insights
- **Current Foundation**: Production-ready core with 80% functionality
- **Greek Localization**: Sophisticated postal/shipping logic already working
- **Test Infrastructure**: MSW integration stabilized, needs micro-fixes
- **API Coverage**: Strong CRUD operations, missing advanced features

### Resource Allocation
- **QA Stabilization**: Highest ROI, immediate impact
- **UI Enhancement**: High visibility, medium effort
- **API Expansion**: Medium priority, foundational for growth
- **Admin Tools**: Lowest priority, future consideration

## 🚀 Next Phase: PR Execution Plan

### Actionable PR Roadmap
**Reference**: [`doc/tasks/pr-roadmap.md`](./pr-roadmap.md) - 5 micro-PRs, ≤30 LOC each

**Week 1 - Critical Fixes (P0)**:
- **PR-001**: Fix Promise.race() test patterns (15 LOC) - Unblocks CI
- **PR-002**: Replace networkidle waits (10 LOC) - Reduces flakiness by 50%

**Week 2 - Core Features (P1)**:
- **PR-003**: User profile API endpoints (30 LOC) - Completes user management
- **PR-004**: Add missing test identifiers (20 LOC) - Stable element selection
