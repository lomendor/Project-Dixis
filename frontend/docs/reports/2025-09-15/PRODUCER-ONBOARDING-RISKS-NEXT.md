# [Task] Producer Onboarding - Risks & Next Actions
**Ημερομηνία:** 2025-09-15
**Σκοπός:** Identify risks and plan next development phase after Producer Onboarding implementation
**Απόφαση/Αποτέλεσμα:** Producer onboarding workflow complete, ready for Product CRUD implementation

## RISKS & TECH-DEBT

### Immediate Risks:

1. **Mock Authentication Gap** - Frontend uses localStorage mock auth instead of real JWT/session management
   - Impact: Production deployment requires complete auth system integration
   - Mitigation: Current structure ready for auth provider swap, minimal refactoring needed

2. **API Mock Implementation** - All API routes return mock data instead of database operations
   - Impact: Backend integration requires Laravel API implementation with Eloquent models
   - Mitigation: API interface contracts defined, ERD models align with Laravel schema

3. **File Upload Missing** - Producer onboarding lacks document upload (tax certificate, business license)
   - Impact: KYC compliance may be incomplete for real-world deployment
   - Mitigation: Form structure extensible, file upload can be added incrementally

4. **Email Notifications Absent** - No email system for producer approval/rejection notifications
   - Impact: Users won't know status changes unless they check dashboard
   - Mitigation: Notification system can be added as separate service layer

### Technical Debt:

1. **Hardcoded Mock Data** - Producer profiles and products use hardcoded test data
   - Action: Replace with Prisma/Laravel Eloquent ORM database operations
   - Priority: High (required for production)

2. **Missing Form Validation** - Server-side validation is minimal (only displayName required)
   - Action: Add comprehensive validation rules for tax ID format, phone numbers, business data
   - Priority: Medium (basic validation exists, enhancement needed)

3. **No Data Persistence** - Form submissions don't persist across page refreshes
   - Action: Implement proper database storage and session management
   - Priority: High (core functionality requirement)

4. **Greek Localization Gaps** - Some error messages and edge cases may lack Greek translations
   - Action: Complete i18n audit and add missing translations
   - Priority: Low (main user flows covered)

### Security Considerations:

1. **CSRF Protection Missing** - API routes lack CSRF token validation
   - Action: Implement Laravel's CSRF middleware for form submissions
   - Priority: High (security vulnerability)

2. **Rate Limiting Absent** - No protection against spam submissions or admin action abuse
   - Action: Add rate limiting middleware to sensitive endpoints
   - Priority: Medium (operational security)

3. **Input Sanitization** - Basic validation present but comprehensive sanitization needed
   - Action: Implement HTML/SQL injection protection in backend validation
   - Priority: High (security requirement)

4. **Admin Role Verification** - Admin role checking relies on client-side claims
   - Action: Implement server-side role verification with proper JWT validation
   - Priority: High (authorization security)

### Data Model Limitations:

1. **Producer Profile Fields** - Current model may be insufficient for complex business entities
   - Action: Consider adding fields for business registration number, VAT status, bank details
   - Priority: Medium (MVP fields sufficient, expansion needed)

2. **Address Integration Incomplete** - ERD Address model exists but not integrated with producer onboarding
   - Action: Add address collection to onboarding form using ERD Address relationships
   - Priority: Medium (shipping/billing addresses needed for commerce)

3. **Multi-Language Content** - Producer business names and descriptions locked to Greek
   - Action: Consider i18n support for business profiles (Greek/English)
   - Priority: Low (Greek market focus appropriate)

## NEXT

### 1) Product CRUD for Approved Producers (Next Immediate Slice)

**Build on Onboarding Foundation**: Use approved producer status workflow
**Leverage ERD Product Model**: Implement full product management with dimensions, pricing, stock
**Core Features**:
- **Create Product**: `/producer/products/create` with form for name, description, price, stock, dimensions
- **Edit Product**: `/producer/products/[id]/edit` with existing data pre-population
- **Delete Product**: Soft delete with confirmation dialog
- **Product Status**: Active/inactive toggle for availability management
- **Stock Management**: Inventory tracking with low-stock alerts

**API Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/producer/products` → create new product
- `PUT /api/producer/products/[id]` → update existing product
- `DELETE /api/producer/products/[id]` → soft delete product
- `PATCH /api/producer/products/[id]/status` → toggle active status

**Target**: 1 PR, ≤300 LOC, using ERD Product model relationships

### 2) Document Upload & KYC Enhancement

**Business Document Collection**: Tax certificate, business registration, identity verification
**File Upload System**: Image/PDF upload with validation and storage
**Admin Review Process**: Document verification workflow in admin interface
**Status Enhancement**: Add "documents_pending" status to producer workflow

**Implementation**:
- File upload component with drag-drop interface
- Document type validation (PDF, JPG, PNG)
- File size limits and security scanning
- Admin document review interface
- Document approval/rejection workflow

**Target**: Integrate with existing onboarding form, maintain ≤300 LOC per PR

### 3) Notification System Integration

**Email Notifications**: Producer status changes, admin actions, important updates
**In-App Notifications**: Dashboard notification center with unread indicators
**Notification Preferences**: User control over notification types and frequency

**Key Notifications**:
- Producer application submitted (admin alert)
- Application approved/rejected (producer email + in-app)
- Product created/updated (admin monitoring)
- Order received (producer notification)

**Technical Approach**:
- Laravel Queue system for email delivery
- React notification context for in-app alerts
- Email templates with Greek localization
- Notification preferences in user settings

### 4) Enhanced Access Control & Audit

**Audit Logging**: Track all admin actions, producer status changes, sensitive operations
**Role-Based Permissions**: Granular permissions within admin role (moderator vs super-admin)
**Session Management**: Proper JWT/session handling with refresh tokens
**Multi-Factor Authentication**: Optional MFA for admin accounts

**Security Enhancements**:
- Admin action audit trail
- IP-based access controls for admin features
- Session timeout and renewal
- Suspicious activity detection

### 5) Shipping Integration with ERD Shipment Model

**Shipping Calculator**: Product weight/dimensions → shipping cost estimation
**Courier Integration**: Real courier APIs (ELTA, ACS, Speedex) using tracking_number field
**Shipping Zones**: Greek postal code-based shipping rules
**Multi-Producer Orders**: Handle orders from multiple producers with separate shipments

**ERD Integration**:
- Use Product dimensions (length_cm, width_cm, height_cm, weight_grams)
- Leverage Shipment model (courier_code, tracking_number, cost_cents, status)
- Address model for shipping calculations
- Order → Shipment relationships for tracking

### Producer Dashboard Analytics (Post-MVP)

**Sales Analytics**: Revenue tracking, top products, seasonal trends
**Order Management**: Order fulfillment workflow using ERD Order/OrderItem models
**Customer Insights**: Customer behavior analysis for producers
**Inventory Management**: Stock alerts, reorder points, seasonal planning

**Business Intelligence**:
- Monthly/weekly sales reports
- Product performance metrics
- Customer retention analysis
- Geographic sales distribution

### Mobile Producer App (Future Sprint)

**Native Mobile**: React Native app for producer order management
**Push Notifications**: Order alerts, low stock warnings, admin messages
**Offline Support**: Basic functionality without internet connection
**Barcode Scanning**: Product management with barcode integration

**Target Audience**: Producers managing inventory on-the-go, order fulfillment from mobile
