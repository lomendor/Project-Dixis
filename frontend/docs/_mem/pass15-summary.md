# Pass 15: CI Quality Gate Fixes

**Date**: 2025-10-02 10:22
**Branch**: feat/phase1-checkout-impl
**PR**: #301

## Objective
Fix CI quality gate failures (linting, commitlint, smoke tests) without modifying business code.

## Actions Taken

### ✅ 1. Commitlint Fix - PR Title Updated
**Issue**: PR title not in conventional format
**Fix**: Updated PR title to conventional format
**New Title**: `test(stabilization): 107/117 passing, 0 failing, 10 skipped — no business changes`

### ⚠️ 2. Linting Analysis
**Issue**: Quality Assurance job failing due to lint warnings
**Finding**:
- Ran `eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx,.js,.jsx -f json`
- Most lint errors are in `src/` (business code) - cannot modify per Code-as-Canon
- Test files (tests/, mocks/, docs/) have minimal issues (mostly `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`)
- These are NOT the cause of CI failure

**Root Cause**: The unused variable warnings in CI logs are from `src/` files:
- `src/app/checkout/page.tsx` - `paymentMethod`, `paymentInit`
- `src/hooks/useCheckout.ts` - `getShippingQuote`, `validateForm`
- `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - `LoadingSpinner`, `triggerError`
- etc.

**Constraint**: Cannot fix without violating Code-as-Canon (no business code changes)

### ❌ 3. Smoke Tests Analysis
**Issue**: Smoke tests failing with exit code 1
**Error**: `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8001` - backend not running

**Root Cause**: Infrastructure issue, not test code
```
❌ Authentication flow error: apiRequestContext.get: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8001
❌ Phase-4 global setup failed: Error: AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_FAILED: all authentication endpoints failed
```

**Finding**:
- Smoke tests expect backend at `127.0.0.1:8001`
- CI workflow doesn't start backend before smoke tests
- This is a workflow configuration issue, not fixable in test code

**Recommendation**:
- Either start backend in smoke test workflow
- Or skip smoke tests in PR workflow (run in integration/deployment pipeline instead)

## Summary of CI Failures

### Can Fix
- ✅ **Commitlint** (PR title) - FIXED

### Cannot Fix (Code-as-Canon)
- ❌ **Quality Assurance** - Lint errors in `src/` business code
- ❌ **Smoke Tests** - Infrastructure issue (backend not running in CI)

### Must Fix in Separate Work
1. **Lint errors in src/**: Remove unused variables in business code
   - Requires careful review to ensure vars truly unused
   - Should be separate PR with proper testing

2. **Smoke test infrastructure**: Update CI workflow
   - Add backend startup before smoke tests
   - Or move smoke tests to different pipeline stage

## Recommendation

**PR #301 Status**: Keep as Draft

The core test suite passes (107/0/10), but CI quality gates require business code changes that violate our Code-as-Canon protocol for this stabilization phase.

**Next Steps**:
1. Create separate issue for lint cleanup in `src/`
2. Create separate issue for smoke test CI infrastructure
3. Consider merging PR #301 with CI exemptions if core tests pass
4. Address quality gates in Phase 2 or separate maintenance PR
