# Pass 15 Final: CI Quality Gate Resolution Attempt

**Date**: 2025-10-02 10:22
**Branch**: feat/phase1-checkout-impl
**PR**: #301

## Objective
Fix CI quality gate failures without modifying business code (Code-as-Canon protocol).

## Actions Completed

### ✅ 1. Commitlint - FIXED
**PR Title Updated**: `test(stabilization): 107/117 passing, 0 failing, 10 skipped — no business changes`
**Status**: Conventional format ✅

### ✅ 2. Test File Lint Cleanup - PARTIAL FIX
**Changes Made**:
- `handlers.pass10.ts`: Prefixed unused `dualShape` helper with `_`
- `checkout-error-handling.spec.tsx`: Removed unused imports (React, vi, render, fireEvent)

**Commit**: c7f0101

## Remaining Issues (Cannot Fix)

### ❌ Quality Assurance - Business Code Lint Errors
**Constraint**: Code-as-Canon protocol prohibits `src/` modifications

**Errors in Business Code**:
```
src/app/checkout/page.tsx
  - paymentMethod (unused)
  - paymentInit (unused)

src/hooks/useCheckout.ts
  - getShippingQuote (unused)
  - validateForm (unused)

src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx
  - LoadingSpinner (unused)
  - triggerError (unused)
```

**Why Cannot Fix**: These files contain business logic. Removing unused vars requires:
1. Verification they're truly unused (not referenced dynamically)
2. Understanding business context
3. Proper testing after removal

This falls outside test stabilization scope.

### ❌ Smoke Tests - Infrastructure Issue
**Error**: `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8001`
**Root Cause**: Backend not started in CI workflow

**Not Fixable via Test Code**:
- Workflow needs backend startup step
- OR smoke tests should run in different pipeline stage
- This is infrastructure/DevOps configuration, not test code

## Final Assessment

### Test Stabilization: ✅ SUCCESS
- **107/117 tests passing**
- **0 failures**
- **10 skipped** (all blocked by implementation gaps)

### CI Quality Gates: ⚠️ BLOCKED
- **Commitlint**: ✅ FIXED
- **Quality Assurance**: ❌ Blocked by business code lint errors
- **Smoke Tests**: ❌ Blocked by CI infrastructure

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Merge Strategy**: Consider merging PR #301 with CI exemptions
   - Core test suite is healthy (107/0/10)
   - Quality gate issues are pre-existing, not introduced by this PR

### Follow-up PRs
1. **Business Code Lint Cleanup** (separate PR)
   - Review and remove unused variables in `src/`
   - Proper testing and validation
   - Not part of test stabilization

2. **Smoke Test Infrastructure** (DevOps task)
   - Update CI workflow to start backend
   - OR move smoke tests to integration pipeline
   - Workflow configuration change

## Summary

**What We Achieved**:
- ✅ Test stabilization complete (107/0/10)
- ✅ Commitlint fixed
- ✅ Test file lint cleanup

**What We Cannot Fix** (per Code-as-Canon):
- ❌ Business code lint errors (requires src/ changes)
- ❌ Smoke test infrastructure (requires workflow changes)

**Recommendation**: The stabilization work is complete and successful. Quality gate failures are due to pre-existing issues outside the scope of this test-focused PR.
