# Pass PRD-AUDIT-STRUCTURE-01: Page Inventory + Content Contracts

**Status**: ✅ DONE
**Created**: 2026-01-17

## Goal

Create explicit documentation for page inventory, user flows, and V1 must-haves to remove guessing and provide clear content contracts.

## Scope

Docs-only pass. No code changes.

## Definition of Done

- [x] Create `docs/PRODUCT/PAGES.md` — All core pages with purpose, sections, data deps, i18n
- [x] Create `docs/PRODUCT/FLOWS.md` — 5 core user journeys documented
- [x] Create `docs/PRODUCT/PRD-MUST-V1.md` — V1 must-haves + out of scope list
- [x] Update STATE.md, AGENT-STATE.md, AGENT-STATE.md
- [x] PR merged

## Deliverables

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/PRODUCT/PAGES.md` | Page inventory (70+ pages cataloged) |
| `docs/PRODUCT/FLOWS.md` | 5 core flows documented |
| `docs/PRODUCT/PRD-MUST-V1.md` | V1 scope + blockers |

## Notes

- Derived from existing routes + PRD-AUDIT + STATE
- i18n coverage summarized (most storefront pages complete, producer/admin TBD)
- Identified 3 blocked items awaiting credentials
