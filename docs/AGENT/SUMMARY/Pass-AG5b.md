# Pass AG5b ‚Äî Unskip 1 Easy E2E Test & Update Inventory

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: TEST UNSKIPPED ‚úÖ

## Objective

Strengthen E2E coverage by unskipping straightforward tests from the skipped tests inventory, excluding complex areas (auth/checkout/payment/admin).

## Changes

### 1. Unskipped Test ‚úÖ

**File**: `frontend/tests/i18n/producers-el.spec.ts:4`

**Test**: `should display Greek producers page content`

**Type**: i18n validation test
- Navigates to `/producers` page
- Validates Greek title contains "Œ†Œ±œÅŒ±Œ≥œâŒ≥ŒøŒØ"
- Validates Greek search input placeholder or label
- Simple UI text validation, no auth or data dependencies

**Risk**: LOW - Straightforward UI text check

**Before** (skipped):
```typescript
test.skip('should display Greek producers page content', async ({ page }) => {
```

**After** (active):
```typescript
test('should display Greek producers page content', async ({ page }) => {
```

### 2. Updated Inventory Report ‚úÖ

**File**: `docs/reports/TESTS-SKIPPED.md`

**Changes**:
- Updated header to reflect Pass AG5b
- Added "Unskipped Tests" section documenting the i18n test
- Updated summary: 36 skipped (was 37), 22 files (was 23)
- Maintained detailed inventory of remaining 36 skipped tests

## Analysis

### Inventory Scan Results

**Total skipped tests found**: 37 (before AG5b)
- 23 files with skipped tests

**Categories of skipped tests**:
1. **Auth-dependent** (11 tests): Require OTP_BYPASS or BASIC_AUTH configuration
2. **Environment-dependent** (5 tests): Dev mode, mailbox availability
3. **Data-dependent** (3 tests): Conditional on product/order data
4. **Schema changes required** (2 tests): Shipping transparency features
5. **Complex setup** (6 tests): Order state management
6. **Not implemented** (1 test): Retry logic
7. **Feature pending** (1 test): Status transitions
8. **Conditional** (7 tests): Various runtime conditions
9. **Unconditionally skipped** (1 test): **i18n/producers-el** ‚Üê **UNSKIPPED in AG5b**

### Safe Candidates Identified

**Searched for**: e2e tests excluding auth/checkout/payment/admin/orders

**Result**: Only 1 safe candidate found
- `frontend/tests/i18n/producers-el.spec.ts:4` - Simple i18n validation

**Why only 1?**
- Most skipped tests have valid conditional reasons (auth config, data availability)
- Many skips are inside test bodies (conditional based on runtime checks)
- Complex areas (auth/checkout/payment/admin) excluded per protocol
- Schema-change tests explicitly marked as TODO

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Created comprehensive skipped tests inventory (37 total)
- [x] Identified safe candidates (1 found, excluding complex areas)
- [x] Unskipped i18n/producers-el test (safe, straightforward)
- [x] Updated TESTS-SKIPPED.md inventory report
- [x] No business logic changes (tests/docs only)
- [x] Created Pass-AG5b.md summary

## Impact

**Risk**: ZERO - Single straightforward i18n test, no auth or data dependencies

**Test Coverage Added**:
- Greek language validation for /producers page
- UI text check for "Œ†Œ±œÅŒ±Œ≥œâŒ≥ŒøŒØ" title
- Search input placeholder/label validation

**Before**: 37 skipped tests
**After**: 36 skipped tests (+1 active)

## Deliverables

1. ‚úÖ `frontend/tests/i18n/producers-el.spec.ts` - Unskipped i18n test
2. ‚úÖ `docs/reports/TESTS-SKIPPED.md` - Updated inventory with AG5b section
3. ‚úÖ `docs/AGENT/SUMMARY/Pass-AG5b.md` - This summary

## Remaining Work

**36 skipped tests remain** with valid reasons:

**Short-term** (No code changes, just configuration):
- 11 tests: Set up OTP_BYPASS for auth tests
- 3 tests: Set up BASIC_AUTH for upload tests
- 3 tests: Configure SMTP_DEV_MAILBOX for email tests

**Medium-term** (Requires data/env setup):
- 5 tests: Dev mode configuration
- 3 tests: Product/order data setup

**Long-term** (Requires code/schema changes):
- 2 tests: Schema changes for shipping transparency
- 1 test: Retry logic implementation
- 1 test: Status transition implementation
- 7 tests: Various feature implementations

## Conclusion

**Pass AG5b: TEST UNSKIPPED ‚úÖ**

Successfully unskipped 1 safe i18n test from the inventory. All other skipped tests have valid reasons requiring either:
- Environment configuration (auth, mailbox)
- Data setup
- Schema changes
- Feature implementation

**No further tests-only unskipping possible** without addressing these dependencies.
