# Pass AG5 â€” Add Shipping Quote Smoke & Wire to CI

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: TESTS ADDED âœ…

## Objective

Strengthen nightly E2E signal by adding lightweight shipping-quote smoke tests covering key Greek postal zones.

## Changes

### 1. New E2E Test: shipping-quote-smoke.spec.ts âœ…

Created `frontend/tests/e2e/shipping-quote-smoke.spec.ts` with 3 API smoke scenarios:

**Test 1: Athens 10431 â†’ COURIER 0.5kg**
- Postal code: 10431 (Athens, Zone A)
- Method: COURIER
- Items: 1 item, 500g, with dimensions
- Subtotal: â‚¬25
- Validates: zone, chargeableKg, ruleTrace array, shippingCost number

**Test 2: Thessaloniki 54622 â†’ COURIER_COD 2Ã—1.2kg**
- Postal code: 54622 (Thessaloniki, Zone B)
- Method: COURIER_COD
- Items: 2 items, 1.2kg each
- Subtotal: â‚¬38
- Validates: zone, chargeableKg, ruleTrace array, shippingCost number, COD handling

**Test 3: Island 85100 (Rhodes) â†’ PICKUP 0.3kg**
- Postal code: 85100 (Rhodes, Zone C - Island)
- Method: PICKUP
- Items: 1 item, 300g
- Subtotal: â‚¬12
- Validates: zone, chargeableKg, ruleTrace array, shippingCost number

### 2. Test Discovery Verification âœ…

```bash
npx playwright test -c playwright.e2e.config.ts --list
# Result: 283 tests in 58 files (includes 3 new shipping-quote-smoke tests)
```

**New Tests**:
- `shipping quote smoke â€º Athens 10431 â†’ COURIER 0.5kg`
- `shipping quote smoke â€º Thessaloniki 54622 â†’ COURIER_COD 2Ã—1.2kg`
- `shipping quote smoke â€º Island 85100 (Rhodes) â†’ PICKUP 0.3kg`

## Technical Details

**Test Type**: Playwright API tests (request context, no browser)
**Endpoint**: `/api/checkout/quote` (POST)
**Dependencies**: None (uses existing shipping engine V2 from Pass SHIP-V2)
**Business Logic**: NO CHANGES (tests-only pass)

**Validation Strategy**:
- Status code < 400 (success responses)
- Required fields present: zone, chargeableKg, ruleTrace, shippingCost
- Type checking: ruleTrace is array, shippingCost is number
- Value ranges: chargeableKg > 0

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Created shipping-quote-smoke.spec.ts with 3 scenarios
- [x] Tests cover 3 Greek postal zones (Athens/Thessaloniki/Island)
- [x] Tests cover 3 shipping methods (COURIER/COURIER_COD/PICKUP)
- [x] Playwright config recognizes new tests (283 total)
- [x] No business logic changes (tests/docs only)
- [x] Updated Pass-AG5.md summary
- [x] Updated STATE.md entry

## Impact

**Risk**: ZERO - Tests only, no production code changes

**Coverage Added**:
- Shipping quote API basic functionality
- Greek postal zone detection (A/B/C)
- Multiple shipping methods
- Weight calculations
- API response structure validation

## Next Steps

1. **CI Integration**: Tests run automatically in e2e-full workflow (nightly & manual)
2. **Branch Trigger**: Manual e2e-full run on feat/passAG5-e2e-quote-smoke for immediate validation
3. **Nightly Runs**: Starting 2025-10-16 02:00 UTC, includes shipping-quote smoke tests

## Deliverables

1. âœ… `frontend/tests/e2e/shipping-quote-smoke.spec.ts` - 3 API smoke tests
2. âœ… `docs/AGENT/SUMMARY/Pass-AG5.md` - This summary
3. âœ… `frontend/docs/OPS/STATE.md` - Updated with AG5 entry

## Conclusion

**Pass AG5: TESTS ADDED âœ…**

Lightweight shipping-quote smoke tests added to E2E suite. Strengthens nightly signal with critical shipping functionality validation across Greek postal zones.

**No business logic changes.** Tests leverage existing SHIP-V2 engine and quote API.
