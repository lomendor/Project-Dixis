    - Email-based OTP (fallback)
    - TOTP Authenticator Apps (planned Q1 2026)
    - Hardware Security Keys (planned Q2 2026)

  Implementation:
    Backend: Laravel Sanctum with custom 2FA middleware
    Frontend: React components with secure token storage
    Session Management: Rotating tokens with automatic expiry

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
  User Roles:
    - Consumer: Product browsing, purchasing, order management
    - Producer: Product management, order fulfillment, analytics access
    - Business: Bulk ordering, team management, procurement tools
    - Admin: System administration, user management, platform configuration

  Permission Matrix:
    Consumer Permissions:
      - product:view, cart:manage, order:create, order:view
      - profile:edit, reviews:create, analytics:view_own

    Producer Permissions:
