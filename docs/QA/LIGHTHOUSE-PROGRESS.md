# Lighthouse Performance Tracking

## Pass 77 — Devtools Throttling Breakthrough ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-04T20:04Z
**Status**: Mobile LCP Measurable

### Results

**Mobile (devtools throttling)**:
- ✅ **LCP: 1544ms (1.5s)** - FIRST MEASURABLE LCP!
- Performance Score: 0 (metrics collection errors)

**Desktop (devtools throttling)**:
- ⚠️ **LCP: null** - Still unmeasurable
- Performance Score: 0 (metrics collection errors)

### Key Findings

1. **Devtools throttling works for mobile**: Unlike `--throttling-method=simulate`, devtools throttling successfully measured mobile LCP at 1544ms
2. **Desktop still problematic**: Desktop LCP remains null even with devtools throttling
3. **Metrics collection errors persist**: Both audits show "Metrics collection had errors" but mobile still captured LCP

### Artifacts Location

- **Summaries** (committed): `docs/QA/LH-SUMMARY*.json`
- **Heavy artifacts** (gitignored, local only):
  - `docs/QA/lh-desktop.json`
  - `docs/QA/lh-mobile.json`
  - `docs/QA/*-devtoolslog.json`
  - `docs/QA/*-trace.json`

### LHCI Workflow Status

- **PR #331** (CI helper integration): OPEN, merge conflicts
- **PR #334** (LHCI workflow): OPEN, merge conflicts
- **Workflow file**: `.github/workflows/lhci.yml` (pending merge)

### Next Steps

1. Resolve merge conflicts in PRs #331 and #334
2. Merge LHCI workflow to enable CI-based Lighthouse audits
3. Investigate desktop LCP measurement issue
4. Consider performance score despite LCP success

### Historical Context

- **Pass 70-72**: NO_LCP errors with simulate throttling
- **Pass 75**: Production server still showed NO_LCP
- **Pass 76**: Created LHCI workflow with devtools throttling
- **Pass 77**: **Breakthrough** - Mobile LCP now measurable

---

**Conclusion**: Devtools throttling is superior to simulate for this application. Mobile LCP measurement is a major milestone for performance tracking.
