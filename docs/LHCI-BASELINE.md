# 🎯 Lighthouse CI - Infrastructure Baseline

**Date**: 2025-09-19
**PR**: #198 - `ci(lhci): run Lighthouse with mock API (no DB), ports 3100/3200`
**Status**: ✅ **MERGED** - Infrastructure Stable

## 📊 Current State

### Infrastructure
- **Mock API**: Express.js server on port 3200 (`scripts/mock-api/lhci-mock.cjs`)
- **Next.js**: Production server on port 3100
- **Database**: ❌ Removed from CI (PostgreSQL dependency eliminated)
- **Policy**: PRs = warn-only | Main branch = enforced thresholds

### Lighthouse Thresholds (Current)
```json
"assertions": {
  "categories:performance": ["warn", {"minScore": 0.6}],
  "categories:accessibility": ["warn", {"minScore": 0.7}],
  "categories:best-practices": ["warn", {"minScore": 0.7}],
  "categories:seo": ["warn", {"minScore": 0.8}]
}
```

### Known Quality Issues (Non-blocking)
- **Color Contrast**: Audit fails (score: 0) - needs design review
- **CSP Headers**: Missing XSS protection (score: 0)
- **Heading Order**: Sequential hierarchy violations (score: 0)
- **Console Errors**: Browser errors logged during tests
- **Service Worker**: PWA features not implemented
- **Text Compression**: Gzip/Brotli not enabled

## 🚀 Achievement

**Problem Solved**: Lighthouse CI was failing due to PostgreSQL setup complexity
**Solution**: Mock API infrastructure with database-free testing
**Result**: Stable CI pipeline with quality visibility

## 🎯 Next Phase

Quality improvements tracked via dedicated GitHub issues (infrastructure stable).
