3. Product detail loads correctly and can be added to cart
4. Producer edits and deletes product successfully

**Testing Patterns**:
- Mock authentication with localStorage
- Element-based waits for stability
- Comprehensive error handling with fallbacks
- Greek localization verification

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Authentication & Access Control
