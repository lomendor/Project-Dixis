## DETAILED FAILURE ANALYSIS

### 1. Frontend Job (Run 17877729395)
**Status**: FAILURE
**Duration**: ~2m14s
**Issue Category**: Build/Start Process

#### Key Observations:
- ✅ **Build succeeded**: Frontend builds successfully with all routes compiled
- ✅ **Node 20**: Running on Node v20.19.5 ✓
- ✅ **Dependencies**: npm ci completed successfully
- ❌ **Start process**: Failure appears during "Start frontend server" step

#### Build Output (Successful):
```
Route (app)                                     Size  First Load JS
├ ○ /                                           5.8 kB         122 kB
├ ○ /_not-found                                 1.07 kB        107 kB
├ ○ /about                                      1.21 kB        107 kB
├ ○ /admin                                      1.3 kB         107 kB
[... 25+ routes successfully built]
```

#### Process Flow:
1. ✅ Backend setup (PostgreSQL container)
2. ✅ Frontend build (`npm run build`)
3. ❌ Frontend start (`npm run start`)

#### Likely Cause:
Server startup issue or port binding conflict during the start phase.

### 2. Run 17877729390 Jobs (Quality Assurance, PR Hygiene Check, Smoke Tests)

**Run ID**: 17877729390
**Affected Jobs**: 3 jobs in same run
**Node Version**: v20.19.5 ✓

#### Common Setup (All 3 Jobs):
- ✅ **Environment**: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS

- ⚠️ **Warnings**: 22 vulnerabilities (8 low, 6 moderate, 8 high)
- ⚠️ **Deprecated**: inflight@1.0.6, rimraf@2.7.1, glob@7.2.3, @gitbeaker/node@35.8.1

#### Dependency Installation Issues:
```
npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory
npm warn deprecated rimraf@2.7.1: Rimraf versions prior to v4 are no longer supported
npm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported
npm warn deprecated @gitbeaker/node@35.8.1: Please use its successor @gitbeaker/rest
```

#### Security Vulnerabilities:
```
22 vulnerabilities (8 low, 6 moderate, 8 high)
To address issues that do not require attention, run: npm audit fix

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Primary Issues Identified:

1. **Frontend Start Process** (Run 17877729395)
   - Build succeeds but server start fails
   - Likely port conflict or environment issue
   - May be related to our PORT=${PORT:-4010} changes

2. **Dependency Ecosystem** (Run 17877729390)
   - Multiple deprecated packages
   - 22 security vulnerabilities
   - Git hooks failing in CI environment

3. **Environment Consistency**
   - Different run IDs suggest timing/concurrency issues
   - Jobs may be competing for resources

### Secondary Factors:

- **Husky Configuration**: `.git can't be found` in CI environment
- **Package Deprecations**: Legacy packages causing warnings
- **Security Alerts**: High-severity vulnerabilities in dependency tree

---

## RECOMMENDED FIXES

### Immediate (High Priority):
1. **Frontend Start Issue**:
   - Investigate port binding in CI environment
   - Add debugging to start process
   - Ensure clean port allocation

2. **Dependency Updates**:
   - Run `npm audit fix`
   - Replace deprecated packages (@gitbeaker/node → @gitbeaker/rest)
   - Update rimraf, glob to v4+

### Medium Priority:
3. **Husky CI Configuration**:
   - Skip git hooks in CI environment
   - Add CI detection to husky config

4. **Resource Isolation**:
   - Ensure jobs don't compete for same ports
   - Add better resource cleanup between jobs

### Low Priority:
5. **Security Hardening**:
   - Address remaining vulnerabilities
   - Update vulnerable packages to secure versions

---

## VERIFICATION STEPS

To confirm fixes:
1. ✅ Lighthouse now passes (port fixes worked)
2. 🔄 Monitor frontend job start process
3. 🔄 Check dependency installation warnings
4. 🔄 Verify all 4 failing jobs turn green

---

## CONTEXT & IMPACT

**PR Purpose**: Unblock PR #172 by fixing Node version and dependency issues
**Risk Level**: Low (CI infrastructure only)
**Functional Impact**: None (workflow changes only)
**Dependencies**: PR #172 waiting on this fix

**Current Status**: 66% pass rate (8/12 jobs passing)
**Target**: 100% pass rate needed for merge and PR #172 unblocking
