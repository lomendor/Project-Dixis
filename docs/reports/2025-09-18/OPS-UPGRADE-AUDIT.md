TL;DR
- Danger rules implement the stated “quality gate++” (LOC caps, docs link, controller test gate, config risk check, workflow/config warnings), matching PR description.
- PR template exists and enforces scope, risk, CI summary, docs links (including dated reports), and change types.
- Subagents scripts write reports to `backend/docs/reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>`; Makefile targets call subagents and CI-like pipelines.
- All checks performed read-only; Makefile targets appear coherent but were not executed.

Artifacts Reviewed
- Danger configuration: `dangerfile.js`
  - LOC thresholds: fail >600 LOC without `large-diff` label; warn >300.
  - Docs report link gate: requires PR body to include today’s reports path (`backend/docs/reports/YYYY-MM-DD/` or `docs/reports/YYYY-MM-DD/`) when changes are significant.
  - Controller change gate: fails if backend controllers modified without corresponding tests.
  - Config change risk gate: fails when `backend/config` or `config/` changed without a risk level in PR body.
  - CI/CD and config change warnings; summary markdown with basic stats.

- PR template: `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
  - Includes Scope, Acceptance Criteria, Risks/Rollback (risk level), CI Summary, Documentation Links (explicit dated reports), Type of Change, Related Issues.
  - Matches Danger expectations for “risk” and docs link content.

- Subagents: `scripts/subagents.sh`
  - Writes to `backend/docs/reports/$DATE` (DATE from `date +%Y-%m-%d`).
  - Sub-commands: `audit` → AUDIT.md, `tests` → TEST-DELTA.md, `docs` → PR-SUMMARY.md, `release` → RELEASE-NOTES-DRAFT.md.
  - `all` runs all subagents; creates report header with timestamp.

- Makefile
  - `qa`: backend phpunit + frontend `npm run qa:all`.
  - `ci-local`: backend tests and pint, frontend qa/build, E2E smoke.
  - `report`: runs subagents `audit` and `docs`, writing under backend/docs/reports/$(date).
  - Other targets: fix, test, build, install, clean.

Verification Notes
- Danger matches description for quality gate and documentation enforcement; rules are concise, targeted, and aligned with described scope.
- PR template present and aligned with Danger assumptions (risk level, docs link).
- Subagents confirm path convention and generate dated reports; docs/dev/SUBAGENTS.md documents commands and mapping to scripts.
- Makefile calls the scripts and common QA tasks; appears coherent for local invocation.

Suggestions
- Consider adding a Danger rule to warn if Makefile targets referenced in PR body are missing or if `scripts/subagents.sh` fails (optional, CI-only).
- Optionally add a CI job that runs `make report` and uploads the generated reports as artifacts for traceability.
- Ensure date/time zones are consistent across CI runners when matching “today” in Danger.

Conclusion
- The ops upgrade PR introduces robust and clear gates/templates/subagents without touching application code. The structure is consistent and ready for CI wiring. No issues found blocking adoption.
