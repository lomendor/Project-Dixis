# ⚠️ SHIPPING ENGINE v1 - RISKS & NEXT PHASE ROADMAP

**Date**: 2025-09-16
**Scope**: Shipping Engine v1 Risk Assessment & Future Planning
**Status**: ✅ **LOW RISK** - Production Ready with Clear Roadmap
**Risk Level**: 🟢 **GREEN** (2/10 - Minimal Production Risks)

---

## 🛡️ CURRENT RISK ASSESSMENT

### 🟢 **LOW RISKS** (Manageable in Production)

#### 1. **Configuration Dependency Risk**
**Risk Level**: 🟡 **MEDIUM-LOW** (3/10)
```
Risk: JSON configuration files could become corrupted or modified incorrectly
Impact: Shipping calculations would fail or return incorrect costs
Mitigation:
├── ✅ Configuration validation on startup
├── ✅ Schema validation for JSON files
├── ✅ Fallback to default rates if config invalid
├── ✅ Version control protection
└── 🔄 Future: Configuration UI with validation
```

#### 2. **Greek Postal Code Evolution Risk**
**Risk Level**: 🟡 **MEDIUM-LOW** (2/10)
```
Risk: Greek postal service could introduce new postal code ranges
Impact: New codes might default to mainland pricing instead of correct zone
Mitigation:
├── ✅ Robust fallback to mainland zone
├── ✅ Regex patterns easily updatable
├── ✅ Configuration-driven (no code changes needed)
└── 🔄 Future: API integration with Greek postal service
```

#### 3. **Volumetric Weight Standard Changes**
**Risk Level**: 🟢 **LOW** (1/10)
```
Risk: Industry standard volumetric factor might change from 5000
Impact: Shipping costs could become uncompetitive
Mitigation:
├── ✅ Factor configurable in ShippingService
├── ✅ Easy to adjust without deployment
├── ✅ Historical tracking of changes possible
└── 🔄 Future: Dynamic factor based on carrier agreements
```

### 🟢 **MINIMAL RISKS** (Very Low Impact)

#### 4. **Label PDF Generation Risk**
**Risk Level**: 🟢 **LOW** (2/10)
```
Risk: PDF generation library could fail or produce invalid labels
Impact: Manual label creation required temporarily
Mitigation:
├── ✅ Currently using stub implementation (safe)
├── ✅ Tracking codes still generated correctly
├── ✅ Manual fallback process documented
└── 🔄 Future: Real carrier API integration
```

#### 5. **Database Performance Risk**
**Risk Level**: 🟢 **LOW** (1/10)
```
Risk: Shipment table could grow large affecting query performance
Impact: Slower tracking lookups and admin operations
Mitigation:
├── ✅ Proper indexing on tracking_code and order_id
├── ✅ Efficient JSON handling for tracking_events
├── ✅ Query optimization implemented
└── 🔄 Future: Archival strategy for old shipments
```
