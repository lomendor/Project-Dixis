TL;DR
- API/Types mismatches between backend and frontend (paths and fields).
- Shipping routes incomplete: wrong handler name; tracking/labels routes missing; no auth middleware.
- Label creation uses wrong carrier code source; no idempotency.
- Frontend hits non-v1 URLs; no debouncing/caching in shipping UI.
- Tests rely on non-existent methods/routes; some flaky patterns.

Critical Findings (Top 5)
- backend/routes/api.php:95 uses `quote` method but controller defines `getQuote`; tracking/labels routes are missing; label action not protected by auth middleware.
- Backend quote payload returns `zone` (not `zone_code`), lacks `carrier_code`; `breakdown` keys differ from frontend shape.
- ShippingService::createLabel uses config key as `carrier_code` (e.g., `ELTA_COURIER`) instead of short code (`ELTA`); no idempotency guard.
- Authorization: controller checks `manage-shipping` gate which is undefined; should use `admin-access` and protect route with `auth:sanctum`.
- Frontend requests `/api/shipping/...` (missing `/api/v1`); components expect fields not produced by backend (strict TS warns).

Detailed Findings

API & Types
- backend/routes/api.php:95
  - Route: `Route::post('quote', [ShippingController::class, 'quote'])` under `Route::prefix('v1')->prefix('shipping')`.
  - Controller method is `getQuote` (see `backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/ShippingController.php:27`).
  - Impact: Handler not found; quote endpoint broken.

- backend/routes/api.php:94-97
  - Missing routes for tracking (`GET /v1/shipping/tracking/{trackingCode}`) and labels (`POST /v1/shipping/labels/{order}` with auth).
  - Tests and frontend call these endpoints; mismatch causes 404.

- backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/ShippingController.php:27
  - `getQuote(...)` validates `postal_code`, builds a temp order, delegates to service.
  - OK; but routes miswired as above.

- backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/ShippingController.php:73
  - Uses `$this->authorize('manage-shipping')` for label creation. Gate is not defined (see `backend/app/Providers/AuthServiceProvider.php:30-36`).
  - Should use `$this->authorize('admin-access')` and the route should require `auth:sanctum`.

- backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/ShippingController.php:102-113
  - Tracking access check uses `can('manage-shipping')` which also doesn’t exist; prefer `Gate::allows('admin-access')` or rework to policy.

- backend/app/Services/ShippingService.php:117-172
  - Returns quote with key `zone` (not `zone_code`), no `carrier_code`; `breakdown` keys are `{ base_rate, extra_cost, billable_weight_kg }` while frontend expects `{ base_cost_cents, weight_adjustment_cents, volume_adjustment_cents, zone_multiplier }`.
  - Impact: Frontend `ShippingQuote.tsx` requires `zone_code`, `carrier_code`, and `_cents` fields; mismatch breaks UI.

- backend/app/Services/ShippingService.php:215-235
  - `createLabel(...)` sets `carrier_code` to `default_carrier` key (e.g., `ELTA_COURIER`), not the actual short code (`ELTA`).
  - Impact: Frontend display and tests expecting `ELTA/ACS/SPX` fail or appear inconsistent.
  - Also no idempotency: on repeated calls, new PDFs are regenerated even if label exists.

- frontend/src/components/shipping/ShippingQuote.tsx:51
  - Calls `'/api/shipping/quote'` (missing `/api/v1`).
  - Expects `ShippingQuoteData` with `zone_code`, `carrier_code`, `breakdown.*_cents` which backend doesn’t supply (see above).
  - useEffect depends on `items` (unstable reference) and `postalCode` without debounce.

- frontend/src/components/shipping/ShipmentTracking.tsx:55,57
  - Calls `/api/orders/{id}/shipment` and `/api/shipping/tracking/...` (missing `/api/v1`).
  - No caching/polling; repeated fetches cause unnecessary network.

- frontend/src/components/shipping/ShippingLabelManager.tsx:47
  - Calls `'/api/shipping/labels/${orderId}'` (missing `/api/v1`) and expects fields (`zone_code`, `estimated_delivery_days`) that backend label response doesn’t guarantee.

Performance & UX
- ShippingQuote.tsx
  - Missing debounce; effect may fire repeatedly on fast typing and when `items` identity changes (mapping from cart spreads new arrays each render).
  - Suggest debounce 300–500ms; depend on `postalCode` and a stable `JSON.stringify(items)` or a memoized key.

- ShipmentTracking.tsx
  - Recommend SWR/react-query with cache keyed by `trackingCode || orderId`; poll every 10–20s only when status is `in_transit`; disable revalidate on focus.
  - Add `data-testid` for robust E2E selectors.

Security & Access
- Label creation should be protected by `auth:sanctum` and `admin-access` gate.
- Add `throttle:10,1` on labels; `throttle:60,1` on tracking.
- Idempotency: If a label exists for an order (`shipment->label_url`), return existing rather than regenerating.
- Tracking endpoint: If guest access by code is intended, keep it public, but ensure logged-in cross-user reads are blocked using a defined gate or policy.

Tests Quality
- backend/tests/Feature/ShippingEngineV1Test.php: uses endpoints `/api/shipping/...` (missing v1) and private methods like `detectZone` that do not exist in service.
- backend/tests/Unit/ShippingServiceTest.php: similarly relies on private method names (`detectZone`, `calculateCostForZone`, `getEstimatedDeliveryDays`, etc.). Service does not implement these; tests will fail or reflect stale design.
- E2E (frontend) files not shown here but existing reports indicate `waitForTimeout` usage and text-matching, which is flaky; prefer `data-testid` and network/selector waits.
- Missing explicit edge-case tests: bulky vs dense items (volumetric vs actual), island surcharge confirmations, multi-producer cart behavior.

Consistency & Hygiene
- Define consistent `data-testid`:
  - ShippingQuote: `shipping-quote-loading`, `shipping-quote-error`, `shipping-quote-success`.
  - ShipmentTracking: `shipment-tracking`, `shipment-events`.
- Align on `/api/v1/...` across frontend and tests.
- Consolidate shipping types with Zod schemas and infer types; move away from divergent hand-written interfaces.

Proposed Zod Schemas (Frontend)
- ShippingQuoteRequest
  - items: [{ product_id: number; quantity: number > 0 }]
  - postal_code: string (5 digits)
  - producer_profile?: 'flat_rate' | 'free_shipping' | 'premium_producer' | 'local_producer'

- ShippingQuoteResponse
  - success: true
  - data: {
      cost_cents: number; cost_eur: number; carrier_code: string;
      zone_code: string; zone_name: string; estimated_delivery_days: number;
      breakdown: { base_cost_cents: number; weight_adjustment_cents: number; volume_adjustment_cents: number; zone_multiplier: number; actual_weight_kg: number; volumetric_weight_kg: number; postal_code: string; profile_applied: string | null }
    }

- ShippingLabelCreateResponse
  - success: true
  - data: { tracking_code: string; label_url: string; carrier_code: string; status: 'pending'|'labeled'|'in_transit'|'delivered'|'failed' }

- OrderShipmentResponse
  - success: true
  - data: { id: number; tracking_code: string; carrier_code: string; status: enum; zone_code?: string|null; shipping_cost_eur?: number|null; shipped_at?: string|null; delivered_at?: string|null; estimated_delivery?: string|null; is_trackable: boolean; is_completed: boolean }

Next Steps
- Wire routes: fix quote handler name, add tracking and labels under `/api/v1/shipping/...`, protect labels with `auth:sanctum` and `admin-access`.
- Align backend responses to include `carrier_code`, `zone_code`, and `_cents` breakdown fields; maintain BC where needed.
- Add idempotency to label creation; map default carrier key to short carrier code.
- Update frontend to call `/api/v1/...`, add debounce and `data-testid`; consider SWR/react-query for tracking.
- Refactor/realign tests to current surface area; add missing edge cases.
