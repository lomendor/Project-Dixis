# PR #220 — E2E/Integration Failure Diagnostics

**Date**: 2025-09-22
**Branch**: `ci/pr216-hotfix-contracts-e2e`
**Commit**: `503ec9f`

## 🔴 CI Status Summary

### Failed Jobs:
- **e2e-tests**: FAIL (6m54s)
- **integration**: FAIL (15m15s - timeout/cancelled)

### Passed Jobs:
- **type-check**: PASS (39s)
- **frontend-tests**: PASS (52s)

## 📊 Failure Analysis

### 1. E2E Test Failures (Critical Pattern)

**Root Cause**: Authentication flow broken - login not redirecting to home page

```
Expected string: "http://127.0.0.1:3001/"
Received string: "http://127.0.0.1:3001/auth/login?email=consumer%40example.com&***"
```

**Affected Tests** (12 failures, 1 skipped):
- ✘ complete shipping checkout flow
- ✘ shipping validation prevents checkout without postal code
- ✘ shipping cost calculation for different zones
- ✘ auth edge case: retry after session timeout
- ✘ volumetric vs actual weight pricing
- ✘ island zone surcharge and longer delivery times
- ⊝ admin label creation (skipped correctly via ADMIN_UI_AVAILABLE flag ✅)

### 2. Integration Test Failure

**Issue**: Test execution cancelled after 15m15s
- safe-playwright-grep.sh started correctly
- Pattern "integration" executed
- Job timeout/cancellation suggests no matching tests or hanging execution

## 🎯 Stabilization Applied (from commit 503ec9f)

✅ **Successfully Applied**:
- Playwright CI timeouts: 180s (vs 60s)
- Admin UI feature flag working (test skipped as expected)
- Reliable selectors implemented

❌ **Not Fixing Root Issue**:
- Authentication flow remains broken
- Login redirect failure is NOT a timeout issue

## 🔍 Key Observations

### What's Working:
- Infrastructure ✅ (PostgreSQL, servers starting)
- Build process ✅ (frontend builds passing)
- Admin test skipping ✅ (feature flag respected)

### What's Broken:
- **Auth redirect logic** - login form submitting but not redirecting
- URL shows email parameter in query string (security concern?)
- All tests depending on auth failing at first step

## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Auth-Specific Hotfix
```typescript
// Check auth redirect logic in frontend/pages/auth/login
// Verify API response handling after login
// Check for Next.js router.push() vs window.location issues
```

### Option 2: Test-Only Workaround
```typescript
// Add explicit wait after login submission
await page.waitForURL('/', { timeout: 30000 });
// OR force navigation after login
await page.goto('/');
```

### Option 3: Skip Auth-Dependent Tests
```yaml
# Temporarily skip shipping tests until auth fixed
run: npx playwright test --grep-invert="shipping|auth"
```

- **PR #221**: https://github.com/lomendor/Project-Dixis/pull/221 (same failures)

## 🔧 Quick Fix Attempt

The timeout stabilization from PR #221 is good infrastructure hardening but **does not address the auth redirect bug**. This is an application-level issue, not a test timing issue.

**Recommendation**: Focus on auth redirect logic in frontend auth components or implement test-specific login helper that bypasses the UI login flow.
