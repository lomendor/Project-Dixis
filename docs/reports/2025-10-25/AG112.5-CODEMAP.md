# AG112.5 — CODEMAP

## Modified File

### .github/workflows/migration-clinic.yml
Fixed the "Validate schema" step to use the correct Prisma command.

**Problem**:
- AG112.4 migrations ALL PASSED successfully (all 7 migrations applied)
- But workflow failed at validation step with: `! Unknown command "validate"`
- Command used: `pnpm prisma db validate` (doesn't exist)

**Root Cause**:
The correct Prisma command is `prisma validate`, not `prisma db validate`.

## Changes Made

### Before AG112.5
```yaml
- name: Validate schema
  run: pnpm prisma db validate  # ❌ Invalid command
```

### After AG112.5
```yaml
- name: Validate schema
  run: pnpm prisma validate  # ✅ Correct command
```

## What This Fixes

**Before AG112.5**:
```
✅ Prisma migrate deploy - ALL 7 MIGRATIONS PASSED
✅ Prisma migrate status - "Database schema is up to date!"
❌ Validate schema - "Unknown command 'validate'"
   ERROR: Process completed with exit code 1
```

**After AG112.5**:
```
✅ Prisma migrate deploy - ALL 7 MIGRATIONS PASSED
✅ Prisma migrate status - "Database schema is up to date!"
✅ Validate schema - Schema validation passes
✅ Workflow completes successfully
```

## Context

**AG112.4 Success**: All migrations work perfectly!
- Migration 1-7 all applied successfully on clean PostgreSQL
- Database schema matches Prisma schema
- Only issue was workflow using wrong validation command

**Workflow Evolution**:
- AG110-AG112.1: Setup Migration Clinic workflow
- AG112.2-AG112.4: Fixed missing tables in migrations
- AG112.5: Fixed workflow validation command (this PR)

## Validation Commands

**Prisma CLI Commands**:
```bash
# ✅ Correct
prisma validate              # Validate Prisma schema
prisma migrate deploy        # Apply migrations
prisma migrate status        # Check migration status
prisma db push               # Push schema to DB (dev)
prisma db pull               # Pull schema from DB

# ❌ Invalid
prisma db validate           # Doesn't exist!
```

## Expected Results

After AG112.5 merge and Migration Clinic run on main:
```
✅ All workflow steps complete successfully
✅ Migrations 1-7 verified working
✅ Schema validation passes
✅ Migration repair saga COMPLETE
```

## Next Steps

**AG113: Production Migration Runbook**
- Document production migration process
- Create rollback plan
- Test on staging environment
- Coordinate production deployment
