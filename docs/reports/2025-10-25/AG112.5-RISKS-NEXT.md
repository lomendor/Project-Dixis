# AG112.5 — RISKS-NEXT

## Risks

- **Πολύ Χαμηλό**: CI workflow fix only, no application code changes
  - **Mitigation**: Single-line command fix in YAML
  - **Validation**: Migration Clinic will run on main after merge

## Testing Strategy

1. **PR CI**: Standard checks (no Migration Clinic needed for workflow fix)
2. **After Merge**: Trigger Migration Clinic on main to verify full green
3. **Expected**: All steps pass including schema validation

## Expected Results

### Migration Clinic Full Success ✅
```
✅ Set up job
✅ Initialize containers
✅ Checkout
✅ Setup Node (no cache)
✅ Enable corepack & setup pnpm
✅ Diag workspace
✅ Install deps
✅ Prepare DATABASE_URL / SHADOW_DATABASE_URL
✅ Prisma generate
✅ Prisma migrate deploy (prod schema)
   → All 7 migrations applied successfully
✅ Prisma migrate status (post-deploy check)
   → Database schema is up to date!
✅ Validate schema  ⬅️ NOW WORKS!
   → Schema validation passes
✅ List migrations
✅ Upload migration artifacts
✅ Complete job
```

## Next Steps

### When AG112.5 Merges ✅

1. **Trigger Migration Clinic on main**
2. **Verify full green workflow**
3. **Celebrate migration repair completion! 🎉**
4. **Move to AG113: Production Migration Runbook**

## Migration Repair Journey - COMPLETE!

### The Full Saga
```
AG110   → Created Migration Clinic workflow
AG110.1 → Fixed working directory & command order
AG112   → Removed pnpm cache, added corepack
AG112.2 → Injected OrderItem table (missing from init)
AG112.3 → Injected Product & Order tables (OrderItem dependencies)
AG112.4 → Fixed publicToken timing (all 7 migrations now pass!)
AG112.5 → Fixed workflow validation command (this PR)
```

### Success Metrics

**Migration Health**: ✅ PERFECT
- 7/7 migrations pass on clean database
- Database schema matches Prisma schema
- All foreign keys working
- All indexes created

**Workflow Health**: ✅ FIXED (after AG112.5)
- All setup steps working
- Migration deploy working
- Migration status working
- Schema validation working (after fix)

## Production Readiness

**After AG112.5**:
- ✅ Migrations proven working on clean PostgreSQL
- ✅ CI/CD validation pipeline complete
- ✅ Migration history repaired and functional
- ✅ Ready for production deployment planning

## AG113 Preview - Production Migration Runbook

**What's Next**:
1. **Staging Deployment**: Test migrations on staging clone of production
2. **Rollback Plan**: Document safe rollback procedure
3. **Downtime Window**: Estimate and schedule maintenance window
4. **Migration Script**: Create production migration execution script
5. **Validation Checklist**: Post-migration verification steps
6. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for migration issues
