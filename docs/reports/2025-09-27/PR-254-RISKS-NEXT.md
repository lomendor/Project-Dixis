# PR #254 - RISKS-NEXT

## Risk Assessment: LOW

### Technical Risks
- **Storage Cost**: Minimal increase due to artifact retention
- **CI Duration**: Negligible impact (parallel uploads)
- **Failure Points**: Upload failures won't affect test results

### Operational Risks
- **Artifact Storage**: ~7 days retention vs 3 days (manageable)
- **Access Patterns**: No change to existing download workflows
- **Cleanup**: GitHub automatic cleanup after retention period

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Monitor**: CI artifact storage usage in repository settings
2. **Adjust**: Retention periods can be reduced if storage becomes concern
3. **Rollback**: Simple revert of added upload steps if needed

### Next Phase Considerations
- **Benefit**: Enhanced E2E debugging capability for infrastructure issues
- **Usage**: Artifacts available for all E2E runs (success/failure)
- **Impact**: Improved developer experience for E2E failures

### Long-term Implications
- **Positive**: Better RCA capability for E2E infrastructure issues
- **Neutral**: Minimal operational overhead
- **Risk**: None identified
