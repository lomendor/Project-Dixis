# PR #254 - TEST-REPORT

## Test Strategy
CI/CD workflow modification - no functional code changes requiring traditional tests.

## Validation Approach
1. **Syntax Validation**: GitHub Actions workflow YAML syntax verified
2. **Path Verification**: Artifact paths match Playwright configuration
3. **Logic Review**: Upload conditions and retention policies verified

## Test Execution
- **Type**: Infrastructure validation
- **Scope**: Workflow syntax and artifact path alignment
- **Result**: âœ… All validations passed

## Test Coverage
- **Workflow Syntax**: 100% (4/4 files validated)
- **Artifact Paths**: 100% (all paths verified against frontend/playwright.config.ts)
- **Retention Logic**: 100% (7-day retention for debugging, 3-day for failures)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Rollback**: Trivial (remove added steps)
- **Monitoring**: CI dashboard will show artifact upload success/failure
- **Verification**: Post-merge CI runs will confirm artifact availability
