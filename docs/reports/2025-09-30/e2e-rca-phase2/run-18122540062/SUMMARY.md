# E2E RCA — Phase 2 (tests-only) — CI run 18122540062

- **Run**: https://github.com/lomendor/Project-Dixis/actions/runs/18122540062
- **Conclusion**: ❌ **FAILURE**
- **PR**: https://github.com/lomendor/Project-Dixis/pull/276
- **Branch**: test/e2e-auth-bootstrap-p0

## Phase 2 Assessment: MITIGATION INEFFECTIVE

### Implemented Changes (Tests-Only)
1. ✅ Added `gotoLoginStable()` helper with 45s timeout + DOM waits
2. ✅ Updated shipping-checkout-e2e.spec.ts to use stable auth bootstrap
3. ✅ Increased auth URL assertion timeout from 20s → 45s

### Failure Analysis
**Same error pattern persists**: TimeoutError on locator.waitFor (20s timeout exceeded)

The 19 error excerpts show **identical failure patterns** to Phase 1 baseline:
- All failures still in `shipping integration E2E tests`
- Same `TimeoutError: locator.waitFor: Timeout 20000ms exceeded`
- Frontend server ready ✅ but auth bootstrap mitigation had no impact

## Key Finding: Root Cause Deeper Than Auth Navigation

The Phase 2 mitigation targeted **auth URL navigation stability** but the actual failures are occurring at the **locator.waitFor** level, suggesting:

1. **Element visibility timeouts** not resolved by URL stabilization
2. **DOM hydration delays** unaffected by auth bootstrap improvements
3. **Possible race conditions** in test element waiting vs app state

## Artifacts Captured
- run.log (331KB)
- excerpts.txt (19 lines of TimeoutError patterns)
- e2e-test-results-always.zip
- e2e-traces-failure.zip
- e2e-videos-screenshots-failure.zip

## Next Steps: Phase 3 Required
Phase 2 approach insufficient. Need **deeper intervention**:
- ✅ Enable `retries: 1` in CI Playwright config for transient failures
- Consider pre-auth storageState to bypass navigation entirely
- Investigate specific locator patterns failing in shipping tests
